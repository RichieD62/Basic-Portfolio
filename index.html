<section>
    <p>My name is Rich Donovan. I grew up in Blaine, Minnesota. I attended Totino-Grace High School and graduated in 2012. I went on to the University of St. Thomas where I studied Marketing and played football. I graduated from the University of St. Thomas in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Marketing Management.</p>
    <p>After college I found a job at a small consulting company called Profit Builder Network in Minneapolis. We help clients with general business practices. My role is to manage business projects and assist with our cleints' marketing needs.</p>
    <p>I began computer programming in 2018 earning a certificate of completion from the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. During the course we were taught to use HTML, CSS, and many other coding languages. Take a look at some of my projects to see if I can meet your programming needs.</p>
